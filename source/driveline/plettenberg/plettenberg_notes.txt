Motor controller startup

1) header 
2) 1 Hz status - analog mode 

To connect:
1) Precharge enable
2) Look for "S="
3) If no S, send S, goto 2
4) Configure params, exit with e, not wp
	When in adjust mode don't check for timeout - well, could, as long as writing quick enough
5) 

Checking for continued connection:
Must receive message within timeout
Must receive "S=" within 1.5 seconds


Add factory reset function
Possible to find verification of reset?


Determine motor state periodically

MC_DISCONNECTED
    check for last rx time -> initializing
MC_INITIALIZING
    wait until you receive S= or A=

MC_ANALOG
    attempt to enter serial
    must wait until S=
    similar to the old moot_init_t

periodically send S if init or analog
have boolean for if parameters set yet 
    clear on initializing and disconnected

enter serial, adjust if necessary

Goals of library:
Quickly connect once motor controller detected
Write setup parameters (only possibly from serial mode)
Ensure serial mode
Quickly detect motor controller connection loss
